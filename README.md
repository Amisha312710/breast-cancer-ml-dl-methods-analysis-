Comparative analysis of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models for breast cancer diagnosis using clinical and histopathological data.
# Breast Cancer Diagnosis using ML and DL – Comparative Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comparative analysis of traditional Machine Learning (ML) models and modern Deep Learning (DL) models for breast cancer diagnosis. The study evaluates performance, robustness, and suitability of different approaches using heterogeneous data modalities.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To analyze classical ML models on structured clinical data
- To develop CNN-based DL models on histopathology images
- To compare ML and DL approaches in terms of accuracy, recall, and reliability
- To study hybrid and ensemble methods for improved diagnosis

## 🧠 Models Used

### Machine Learning (Tabular Data Wisconsin Dataset)
- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Random Forest  
- Hybrid Voting & Stacking Classifiers  

### Deep Learning (Image Data  Histopathology)
